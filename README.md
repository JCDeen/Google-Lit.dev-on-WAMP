# Google-Lit.dev-on-WAMP

Read the source in deen.html to see exactly how this was installed on a typical WAMP setup on Windows 10 PC.

The code in <b>deen.html</B> yields the screen seen below, after the horizontal rule, in a Firefox browser.<br />
The code in <b>deen-using-cdn.html</b> does the same as <i>deen.html</i>, but imports the <i>lit.dev</i> code from a CDN.<br />
The code in <b>deen-using-cdn-timers.html</b> is the timers example from <i>lit.dev</i>, and it also imports the lit.dev code from a CDN.<br>
All 3 of those example HTML files ran perfectly on my WAMP installation on Windows 10. <i>(as of 12/07/2022)</i>
